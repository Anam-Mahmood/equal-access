            The IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker is a browser extension
            that allows users to evaluate a web-based component or solution for
            accessibility issues against the latest WCAG 2.1 standards with
            explanations and suitable fixes right within the tool.{" "}

            The tool reports three kinds of accessibility issues:
          </div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>

                  alt=" "
                />
                <strong> Violation</strong> - accessibility failures that need to
                be corrected.
              </li>
              <li>
                <img

                  alt=" "
                />
                <strong> Needs review</strong> - issues that may not be a
                violation. These need manual review to identify whether there is
                an accessibility problem.
              </li>
              <li>
                <img

                />
                <strong> Recommendation</strong> - opportunities to apply best
                practices to further improve accessibility.

            <p>
              As with any automated test tool for accessibility, these tests
              donâ€™t catch all issues. Complete your accessibility assessment
              with a quick unit test for accessibility or follow the full
              accessibility test process.

          <div id="view">
            <h2>4. Ways to view the issues</h2>
            There are three ways to view and explore the issues identified by
            the tool. All views show the same set of issues:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Checklist</strong> - issues are organized by the
                relevant checkpoints of the IBM Checklist, which corresponds to
                the WCAG 2.1 standards. Each issue is mapped to exactly one
                checkpoint. This view makes it easy to see how to classify and
                report issues found by the tool.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Element roles </strong>- issues are organized in the
                hierarchical structure defined by the WAI-ARIA roles of the DOM
                elements. This view shows both implicit and explicit roles. It
                does not show element names. This view is ideal for exploring
                the issues within a specific element and its children.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rules</strong> - issues are organized by the rules in
                the rule set, with violations listed first, followed by items
                that need review, and then recommendations. This view is the
                best way to see all the violations listed together.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="t_select_settings">
            <h2>5. Options</h2>
            By default, the IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker uses a set of
            rules that correspond to the most recent WCAG standards, and these
            rules are updated regularly. If you need to test against a different
            standard or a specific rule set version, use the options to select
            the archived rule set by date of deployment and standard used.

              </li>
              <li>
